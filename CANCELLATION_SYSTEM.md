# Cancellation System Implementation

## Overview

The VenueVista app now includes a comprehensive booking cancellation system that allows users to cancel their bookings with reasons and tracks all cancellation data for admin processing.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (`cancellations_table.sql`)

- **Cancellations Table**: Stores all cancellation records with proper foreign key relationships
- **Fields**:

  - `booking_id`: References the cancelled booking
  - `user_id`: User who cancelled the booking
  - `venue_id`: Venue where the booking was cancelled
  - `cancelled_at`: Timestamp of cancellation
  - `cancellation_reason`: User-provided reason (optional)
  - `cancellation_fee`: NULL by default (for admin processing)
  - `refund_amount`: NULL by default (for admin processing)
  - `refund_status`: NULL by default (for admin processing)

- **Cancellation Summary View**: Aggregated view joining cancellations with booking and venue data
- **RLS Policies**: Secure access control for authenticated users
- **Indexes**: Optimized queries on user_id, venue_id, and cancelled_at

### 2. Service Layer (`BookingService`)

- **`cancelBookingWithReason()`**: Main cancellation method with comprehensive error handling
- **NULL Value Storage**: Processing fields (fee, refund_amount, status) set to NULL for admin workflow
- **Validation**: Checks user authentication and booking ownership
- **Logging**: Detailed debug information for troubleshooting

### 3. UI Components (`schedule_page.dart`)

- **Cancellation Dialog**: Multi-line text input for cancellation reasons
- **Validation**: Ensures booking exists and belongs to current user
- **User Feedback**: Loading states and success/error messages
- **Controller Management**: Proper disposal of text editing controllers

## Data Flow

### Cancellation Process

1. User taps "Cancel Booking" from schedule page
2. Cancellation dialog appears with reason input field
3. User enters cancellation reason (optional)
4. System validates user authentication and booking ownership
5. Cancellation record inserted into `cancellations` table with NULL processing fields
6. Booking status updated to 'cancelled' with timestamp
7. User receives confirmation of successful cancellation

### Database Storage

```sql
-- Example cancellation record
{
  "id": "uuid-generated",
  "booking_id": "existing-booking-uuid",
  "user_id": "authenticated-user-uuid",
  "venue_id": "venue-uuid",
  "cancelled_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "cancellation_reason": "Unable to attend due to weather",
  "cancellation_fee": NULL,    -- For admin processing
  "refund_amount": NULL,       -- For admin processing
  "refund_status": NULL        -- For admin processing
}
```

## Error Handling

### Comprehensive Error Detection

- Foreign key constraint violations
- RLS policy permission issues
- NULL constraint violations
- Network connectivity problems
- Authentication failures

### User-Friendly Messages

- Clear success confirmations
- Specific error descriptions
- Troubleshooting guidance
- Retry mechanisms where appropriate

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Login** to the app as a regular user
2. **Create a booking** for any venue
3. **Navigate to Schedule** page
4. **Find your booking** in the list
5. **Tap Cancel button** on the booking
6. **Enter cancellation reason** in the dialog
7. **Confirm cancellation**
8. **Verify success message** appears
9. **Check booking status** changes to "Cancelled"

### Database Verification

```sql
-- Check cancellation was recorded
SELECT * FROM cancellations
WHERE user_id = 'your-user-id'
ORDER BY cancelled_at DESC;

-- Verify NULL processing fields
SELECT
  cancellation_reason,
  cancellation_fee,    -- Should be NULL
  refund_amount,       -- Should be NULL
  refund_status        -- Should be NULL
FROM cancellations
WHERE booking_id = 'your-booking-id';

-- View summary data
SELECT * FROM cancellation_summary
WHERE user_id = 'your-user-id';
```

### Test File

- `test/cancellation_test.sql`: Database schema validation and NULL value testing

## Admin Processing Workflow

### Future Enhancements

The NULL values in processing fields enable a future admin workflow:

1. **Review Cancellations**: Admins query cancellations with NULL processing status
2. **Calculate Fees**: Determine cancellation fees based on timing and policy
3. **Process Refunds**: Calculate refund amounts after deducting fees
4. **Update Status**: Set refund_status to 'processed', 'pending', or 'denied'
5. **Audit Trail**: Complete record of all cancellation processing steps

## Key Benefits

### For Users

- **Easy Cancellation**: Simple one-tap cancellation with optional reason
- **Transparency**: Clear confirmation and status updates
- **Flexibility**: Optional reason field allows detailed explanations

### For Venue Owners

- **Cancellation Tracking**: Complete visibility into booking cancellations
- **Reason Analysis**: Understanding why customers cancel bookings
- **Revenue Impact**: Data for analyzing cancellation patterns

### For Admins

- **Processing Workflow**: NULL values enable systematic refund processing
- **Financial Control**: Separate fee calculation from initial cancellation
- **Audit Compliance**: Complete record of all cancellation activities

## Technical Implementation

### Code Structure

- **Database**: PostgreSQL with RLS and foreign key constraints
- **Backend**: Supabase with automatic timestamp triggers
- **Frontend**: Flutter with reactive UI updates
- **Error Handling**: Multi-layer validation and user feedback

### Performance Optimizations

- **Indexed Queries**: Fast retrieval by user, venue, and date
- **Batch Operations**: Single transaction for cancellation + status update
- **Minimal Data Transfer**: Only necessary fields in API calls

### Security Features

- **Row Level Security**: Users can only access their own cancellations
- **Authentication Required**: All operations require valid user session
- **Input Validation**: Sanitized user input for cancellation reasons
- **Ownership Verification**: Double-check booking belongs to current user

## Status

âœ… **COMPLETED**: All cancellation system features implemented and tested

- Database schema with NULL processing fields
- Service methods with comprehensive error handling
- UI components with reason input dialog
- Enhanced logging and debugging capabilities
- Test validation scripts

The cancellation system is now ready for production use with proper NULL value storage for admin processing workflow.
